# Stock Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on extracting and visualizing stock market data for two companies, GameStop (GME) and Tesla. It includes:
- Extracting stock revenue data for GameStop (GME) and displaying the last five rows of the dataset.
- Plotting Tesla stock prices up to June 2021.
  
This project demonstrates basic stock data analysis techniques using Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib.

## Features
- **Data Extraction:** Fetches stock data for GameStop and Tesla using the Yahoo Finance API (via `yfinance`).
- **Data Visualization:** Uses Matplotlib to plot Tesla stock prices over time.
- **Data Insights:** Displays the last five rows of the GameStop stock data for analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** The primary language used to implement data analysis.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and processing.
- **Matplotlib:** For visualizing stock data.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For an interactive environment to work on the project.
- **yfinance:** For downloading historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
